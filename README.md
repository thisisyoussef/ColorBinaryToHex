## Project Overview

This C# solution contains a single function which takes in a color binary string and outputs its hexadecimal representation. The solution is designed with performance and simplicity in mind.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ColorBinaryToHex.git`.
2. Open the ColorBinaryToHex.sln file in a C# development environment like Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

## Usage Guide

1. Import the ColorBinaryToHex namespace into your project.
2. Create a new instance of the `ColorBinaryToHexConverter` class in your code.
3. Call the `Convert` method on the instance, passing the binary color string as a parameter.
4. Use the returned hexadecimal color string as per your requirements.

Example usage:

```csharp
using ColorBinaryToHex;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class MyClass
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            string binaryColor = "111111110000000011111111";
            ColorBinaryToHexConverter colorConverter = new ColorBinaryToHexConverter();
            string hexColor = colorConverter.Convert(binaryColor);
            Console.WriteLine("Hexadecimal color: " + hexColor);
        }
    }
}
```

## Features and Functionality

- Converts 24-bit color binary strings to their 6-digit hexadecimal representation.
- Handles valid binary strings containing 1s and 0s.
- Throws a meaningful exception for invalid input.
