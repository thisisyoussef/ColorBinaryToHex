# ColorBinaryToHex

ColorBinaryToHex is a utility tool for converting binary color codes to hexadecimal format. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for developers and designers working with different color formats, particularly those who require a quick and reliable method for conversion between the two most commonly used color code formats, binary and hexadecimal.

## Project Overview
ColorBinaryToHex is a .NET-based project that uses C# as its programming language. The core functionality of the project is provided by the custom-implemented conversion algorithm which effortlessly translates binary codes to hexadecimal format. The tool's simplicity and efficiency make it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

## Installation Instructions
To install and run ColorBinaryToHex, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ColorBinaryToHex.git
```
2. Open the `ColorBinaryToHex.sln` file in Visual Studio or any other compatible .NET IDE.
3. Build the solution to restore any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the application from within your IDE.

## Usage Guide
The primary purpose of ColorBinaryToHex is to convert binary color codes to hexadecimal format. To use the tool, simply input a valid binary color code into the application. The tool will then automatically convert the binary code to its corresponding hexadecimal format and display the result.

Please note that a valid binary color code must consist of 24 bits, where each group of 8 bits represents the red, green, and blue values of the color, respectively.

## Features and Functionality
ColorBinaryToHex offers the following features:

- A simple and user-friendly interface with easy-to-use input fields.
- Efficient and accurate conversion algorithm for converting binary color codes to hexadecimal format.
- Customizable settings for adjusting the tool's functionality according to user preferences (e.g., automatic conversion vs. user-initiated conversion).
- Support for both little-endian and big-endian byte orders to cater to all users, regardless of their hardware and software setups.
